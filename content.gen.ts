Such an innocent question, isn&#39;t it? Yet it truly\npuzzled me that I didn&#39;t have a definitive answer. Most of my clothes were\nblack, but I wasn&#39;t sure if that was because I liked it or because someone at\nsome point convinced me that it would make me look slimmer or wouldn&#39;t show\nstains as easy as lighter colours. How do I know what I like? Can I just choose\nsome random colour and decide that from now on that would be my favourite?</p>\n<p>My therapist said that it doesn&#39;t work this way. Apparently one is supposed to\njust know what you want. Well, at that point I didn&#39;t want anything. I didn&#39;t\ncare much about myself then and most of my efforts have been spent on other\npeople. Other people were very important force in my life: they were deciding\nhow I should look and behave, what I&#39;m allowed to wear, where I should spend my\nmoney and nearly everything else.</p>\n<p>I don&#39;t blame them, I wouldn&#39;t know who to blame, to be honest: after so many\nyears I wouldn&#39;t be able to trace where my limiting beliefs came from even if I\ntried. Faceless generic &quot;others&quot; was a monstrosity with many faces and voices\nand not a shred of compassion or empathy.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve been this way up until the moment the same therapist comfirmed that I was\nundoubtfully autistic. It might not sound like much, but for me it meant the\nworld: I was very very different from the <em>others</em> and thus their beliefs could\nno longer apply to me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"who-am-i-really\">Who am I, really?</h2>\n<p>Asking myself this question at the ripe age of 36 was a bit weird to say the\nleast, but at that point I&#39;ve accepted that <em>weird</em> is my new normal.</p>\n<p>I started digging into my own psyche as if it would be a codebase I&#39;m seeing for\nthe first time: I tried to find patterns and refrain from judgement.</p>\n<p>I assumed there was a <em>core</em>; something that makes me my authentic self. It must\nbe something permanent or at least long lasting, something that would describe\nme years ago, today and in the future.</p>\n<p>Well, I was autistic, for starters; this influenced the way I perceive the world\naround me, the way I behave and explains why my emotions have always been so\nmuch stronger than <em>others</em> expected of me.</p>\n<p>So, the emotions then are influenced by my identity, right? If so, I could use\nit to reverse-engineer my core values!</p>\n<p>I started to really listen to my emotions: I&#39;ve journaled every single day,\nspent many hours with myself and talked obsessively about my feelings with\nanyone who would listen to try and pinpoint why I felt the way I felt.</p>\n<p>One of the things that I&#39;ve realised was that I value deep emotional connections\nmore than anything else: having authentic relationships has always been my first\npriority. But it only became obvious when I heard Bren√© Brown&#39;s talk about\nvulnerability: I had a surge of emotions and a feeling of being truly seen and\nunderstood.</p>\n<p>As a result I&#39;ve started to learn how to be more vulnerable and less afraid.\nThat meant speaking up, sharing my thoughts, ideas and creations without knowing\nfor sure how they would be received. Whenever I was in doubt I just needed to\nask myself if would I still do it even no one else would accept it?</p>\n<p>It was scary the first couple of times. Of course, I started with the things\nthat wouldn&#39;t have significant effect: like sharing some ideas about\nimprovements at work. I knew that if they wouldn&#39;t be accepted - it wouldn&#39;t\ncost me anything, except for maybe a bit of a hurt pride.</p>\n<p>To my surprise it didn&#39;t hurt as much as I imagined. I guess being ready for a\nchallenge somehow made me more resilient to a failure. But most of my sugestions\nhave been met with praise and that gave me confidence to start taking bigger\nrisks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-letting-go-and-drawing-lines\">The art letting go and drawing lines</h2>\n<p>I liked being celebrated! I liked being taken seriously! And quickly realised I\nwanted to feel this way most of the time. I&#39;ve started celebrating myself: this\nfelt too important to outsource. I wrote myself letters, saying all the things I\nwanted to hear from others, pointing out all my achievements and reminding\nmyself that every little mistake I make gives me an opportunity to grow and be\neven better.</p>\n<p>That worked quite well! I was finally starting to accept myself unconditionally\nand gaining more and more confidence.</p>\n<p>The more my self-esteem grew the less tolerant I was becoming to being treated\nless than I deserved. I didn&#39;t yet know what I wanted, but I was certain about\nwhat I didn&#39;t want.</p>\n<p>I was surprised how easy it was to let go of my marriage: I knew I didn&#39;t want\nany more lies and uncertanty and, since my every attempt to communicate my needs\nand find a compromise failed, my conscience was clear.</p>\n<p>I let go of people who couldn&#39;t respect my newly found needs. It was scary to\nset boundaries at first, but my daughters helped me a lot with it - they were\namong the first ones to accept and help me maintain them. Which was surprising,\nas we used to fight a lot about the same mundane stuff them making a mess and\nnot cleaning up or making avoidable noise when I was trying to concentrate, to\nname a few.</p>\n<p>And yet, when I was able to calmly communicate what I needed, they started to\neither respect it or negotiate an alternative to match their needs as well. We\nstill have screaming matches every once in a while, after all they are very\nyoung and I&#39;m still learning too, but we got so much closer to each other and\ncan now proactively care for one another!</p>\n<p>Who would have thought that boundaries can do that?!</p>\n<h2 id=\"budgeting-the-fs-to-give\">Budgeting the f***s to give</h2>\n<p>I clearly care a lot about my children and that I wouldn&#39;t want to change ever,\nyet a lot of other things I cared about used to get in a way of that. My first\nthree years in Sweden I spent working long hours to try and make the company I\nworked for succeed. I told myself that I did it for my family: our finances were\nscarce and I rationalised that more money would solve all of our problems.</p>\n<p>But, truth be told, I was using my work to hide from said problems: working a\nlot was tiring, but it was also easy because I knew exactly what to do at every\ngiven moment. Not to mention the praise I was receiving for being such a hard\nworker! Would I work as much if I knew that the startup worked for would fail?\nNo, I wouldn&#39;t. I desperately wanted to matter and I hoped that if I&#39;d succeed\npublicly that would mean that I&#39;m worth something.</p>\n<p>I did learn a lot from this experience and thus I don&#39;t feel like my time was\nwasted, but I do see now how valuable my time is. There&#39;s a limited amount of\nhours in any given day and I&#39;m pretty sure that eventually I&#39;ll start getting\nolder. And so there&#39;s a strictly limited amount of f*cks I can give.</p>\n<p>Just like I started to learn how to be financially responsible by chosing the\nbiggest value for the least amount of money, I started to consciously choose who\nand what I spend my energy on.</p>\n<p>I couldn&#39;t care anymore about the things outside of my control as no matter how\nmuch resources I poured I would&#39;ve made zero difference. Flushing down the drain\ndidn&#39;t sound like a smart investment after all!</p>\n<p>I was still taking risks, sometimes I was losing miserably, sometimes I was\nhitting a jackpot and mostly I found myself somewhere in between those two. But\ndecision making became easier: I could just imagine several outcomes, analyse my\nemotions, match whatever I was trying to achieve with my core values and needs\nand make a consious choice of how I wanted to proceed.</p>\n<p>With every choice I made I gained a deeper insight on what I wanted and soon\nenough I could visualise and more importantly verbalise my desires in details.\nAs well as the reasons behind those wants and needs.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s a process and there&#39;s a lot of room for improvement still, yet my life\nbecame much more joyous than it had ever been before.</p>\n<p>My favourite colour is white, by the way. I chose it to be back then, but I\ntruly like it. White reminds me of blank canvas and freedom, makes me feel a\nlittle like a rebel and means the brightest light for me.</p>\n<p>Though my wardrobe went through much wilder changes and includes pretty much\nevery color of the spectrum.</p>\n<p>After all, I am so much more than others would possibly think of me, why would I\nsettle for any less than everything that I want!</p>\n"}};
