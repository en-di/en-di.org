Back then I was already told that I was bigger, heavier and fatter\nthan other children my age and, because I was a nice and obedient girl, I wanted\nto fix that flaw of mine.</p>\n<p>One year later my mother was very happy with me when the doctor told her that my\nweight was getting better and soon enough I won&#39;t be obese anymore, just\noverweight! She made a joke how she&#39;d carry me in her arms for the next\nappointment.</p>\n<p>But that didn&#39;t happen, instead, when I started school my weight soared. The\nthought that I was flawed had now rooted deeply enough to never leave my mind. I\ndidn&#39;t just occasionally remembered to suck my stomach in; no, I have been\nacutely aware of my size and shape at every moment of my existence. And to make\nsure I&#39;d never forget I was constantly reminded of it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"eating-disorders-and-other-ways-to-be-popular\">Eating disorders and other ways to be popular</h2>\n<p>I was put on various diets; back in the day separate eating was all the rage,\nthank god keto wasn&#39;t a thing yet! I learned to drink tea without sugar,\ntolerate supplements, one of which looked and tasted exactly like dirt, but\nnothing made a difference! I was getting chubbier by the second and at the age\nof twelve I weighed more than 70 kilos.</p>\n<p>I looked like a teacher on my school pictures, not only due to my weight, but\nalso because there wasn&#39;t any clothes for children my age and size.</p>\n<p>Once, I did lose a whole 5 kilos after a couple of weeks of all-inclusive resort\nvacation, which came as a surprise to me! I ate whatever I wanted there after\nall! But my underdeveloped frontal lobe couldn&#39;t yet comprehend the reasons\nbehind that and so I brushed it under the rug of miracle and hoped that my lucky\nstrike would continue.</p>\n<p>Except it didn&#39;t. As I entered my teenage years and my peers started dating, the\nsituation got worse. I didn&#39;t need to think why: I was told that I wasn&#39;t\ndateable because whenever I walked by the side of my crush we look like Timon\nand Pumba, with me being the latter.</p>\n<p>I accepted that. I wasn&#39;t yet ready to give up the comfort of food, so I tried\nto compensate excess of my body with wits and personality. It kind of worked, as\nmost of the boys genuinely wanted to hang out with me now, but only as friends.</p>\n<p>It did take a tall on my health though: to be a buddy I needed to learn how to\nsmoke and chug beer like a pro. And yes it did require some effort, specially\nwith smoking, that crap was disgusting!</p>\n<p>At some point I gave in and decided to lose weight no matter what. At the time\nmy mother was dating a guy that was into starvation cleansing (yeah, I know) and\nthat inspired me to go on three weeks of not eating anything at all.</p>\n<p>I drank mineral water, tea and took long naps after school; smoking also kept my\nappetite in check and after three weeks I&#39;ve lost 18 kilos! Impressive, right?</p>\n<p>Well, I gained 5 of them in the following week. The rest came with friends\nmonths later. But the most devastating part was that nothing really changed: I\ndidn&#39;t become girlfriend material even after that torture.</p>\n<p>For a long time I didn&#39;t have it in me to try another diet. I came up with\nanother approach though. There was this one thing that was on all the boys&#39;\nminds and at that point I was desperate enough to keep an open mind.</p>\n<p>I looked much older and I used it to my advantage. I still wasn&#39;t dateable, but\nI was desired. My first sexual encounter happened when I was fourteen and no,\nthe man I was with didn&#39;t know that.</p>\n<p>So as a recap, by the time I graduated school I had a binge-eating disorder, I\nwas smoking, drinking and had quite of a disordered sexual life.</p>\n<p>I did get into a long term relationship couple of years after that with a friend\nof mine who was also considered undateable. Mostly because I felt like we\nbelonged together being the ugly ducklings.</p>\n<p>That worked for a while, but I&#39;ve started to realize that I still was not happy.\nAnd, of course, I&#39;ve decided that the key to my happiness was to lose weight\nonce again.</p>\n<p>This time I spent months on a diet where I ate 500 kcal a day and meticulously\ncounted them. Inevitably I&#39;ve lost weight a lot of weight. I was finally able to\nwear any clothes I wanted! I was slim!</p>\n<p>And yet, I wasn&#39;t happy.</p>\n<p>My boyfriend berated me for carrying food boxes everywhere I went, for quitting\ndrinking and smoking and making him feel bad about himself. Even though he was\nproudly showing me off in public, we fought more than ever before.</p>\n<p>Eventually, I called it off. I knew that I couldn&#39;t possibly stay in this\nrelationship anymore. And finally, not so long after that, I married a person I\ntruly liked and got a family I wanted.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heavily-ever-after\">Heavily ever after</h2>\n<p>My marriage was not the fairy tale I expected, but I couldn&#39;t give up so easily,\ncould I? I worked hard, I spent all my energy and resources on making it less\ngrim.</p>\n<p>By the time I gave birth to my first daughter I was at my heaviest. And the\nsecond pregnancy that came just three months after added even more.</p>\n<p>I moved countries, I became really good at my job and I also became morbidly\nobese. I tried losing weight every once in a while, but it always came back no\nmatter what I did.</p>\n<p>It took me a while to match my weight gain with level of stress in my life, but\nI got there. Now it was finally making sense why I gained weight when I was\nbullied at school and when my perfect partner turned out to be something\nentirely different.</p>\n<p>When we were separating he told me that I&#39;m still beautiful, but I&#39;ll have\nbetter chances at finding a new partner if I lose weight. &quot;For the health\nreasons, of course&quot;, - he added.</p>\n<p>But what are those reasons? He was fit, ripped and so very sick, while morbidly\nobese me had been just deemed perfectly fine by several doctors.</p>\n<p>You see, I never had a problem with high pressure or blood sugar despite of\nbeing told I&#39;d have diabetes just like my grandma, flat feet or that I&#39;d develop\na heart condition!</p>\n<p>And yet here I was healthy regardless of everything I went and put myself\nthrough.</p>\n<h2 id=\"live-it-like-im-fit\">Live it like I&#39;m fit</h2>\n<p>A friend of mine suggested to try exercising for the sole benefit of the stress\nrelief. So did my therapist and, as a nice obedient girl that I was, I&#39;ve\ndecided to give it a try.</p>\n<p>I haven&#39;t done sports for fun since I was five, but it felt nice to not worry\nabout calories and do whatever I felt like doing.</p>\n<p>I enjoyed walking and doing home workouts guided by women who looked like me. I\nfound <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@KamoyaFarray\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@KamoyaFarray</a> the first time I\nsearched for &quot;plus size workout&quot; and loved it so much that I didn&#39;t bothered to\nlook further, but I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a lot more.</p>\n<p>Little by little I&#39;ve started to notice my body for what it was right here and\nright now, regardless of anyone else. Slowly I&#39;ve started to like my reflection\nmore and more.</p>\n<p>For the past months I follow the simplest of routines for eating and exercises:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/healthy-and-obese-at-the-same-time/routine.png\" alt=\"Breakfast 7am, Exercises 11am, Lunch 12pm, Dinner 5pm\"></p>\n<p>I don&#39;t have a strict food policy. I prefer plant based food, but luckily for me\nthere&#39;s plenty of snacks and fast food that fit into that category. I truly eat\nwhatever I want. I love unfiltered non-alcoholic bear every once in a while and\na specific brand of chips from a nearby Polish store. Most of my meals are quick\nmix of frozen vegetables, rice, soy meat or beans with mustard or ketchup. I\nstopped drinking coffee because I never really liked it and, as much as I love\nrye bread, I&#39;m avoiding it because it gives me a heartburn.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve let my diet develop naturally and balance itself like if I wouldn&#39;t need to\nlose weight.</p>\n<p>On average I walk between 3-7km a day, sometimes I skip exercises in favour of a\nlonger walk, sometimes I do kettlebells, sometimes I go swimming and sometimes I\ndo nothing. I let my body decide what it needs and wants at the moment. For\nbeing so unhealthy it sure is capable of so many different things!</p>\n<p>I am slowly replacing my wardrobe with clothes I really like. Luckily nowadays I\ncan find almost anything in XL: from bikini and crop tops to waist-fitted\nbusiness casual, all of which look really good on my hour-glass figure.</p>\n<p>I wouldn&#39;t call myself fat, as, according to my scale, more than half of my body\nweight is muscle mass, though I wouldn&#39;t call myself &quot;muscle&quot; either. I prefer\n&quot;curvy&quot;, &quot;full figured&quot; or &quot;plus size&quot; over &quot;big&quot;, &quot;chubby&quot; and definitely over\n&quot;(morbidly) obese&quot;, but ultimately I give less and less importance to those\nlabels.</p>\n<p>It took me a long time to accept the fact that my mind was different from what\nis considered a norm, it feels logical to try and accept the rest of me as well.</p>\n<p>After all, I&#39;m so much happier now when I don&#39;t need to lose weight and can\nfinally let my body naturally take the shape it is supposed to take.</p>\n<p>I don&#39;t know how much weight I lost or gained anymore, but I like how I look\nmore and more every day. That newly found confidence goes well with my eyes, I\nsuppose, and I&#39;ll wear it unapologetically.</p>\n"},"the-chosen-one-and-other-things-i've-learned-about-love":{"title":"The Chosen One and other things I've learned about love","date":"2023-06-02T18:53:10.935Z","author":"ValeriaVG","tags":["love","relationships","identity"],"summary":"Love is in the air! I do find that Pride month a better celebration of love than a Valentine's day.\nBoth because love deserves much more than one day and because I'm convinced that love is about choices.\n","url":"the-chosen-one-and-other-things-i've-learned-about-love","content":"<p>Love is very different from it&#39;s media portrayal. I think it&#39;s very individual\nreally: it will be unique and special for every single unit.</p>\n<p>I used to believe in love at first sight: I longed to be swept of my feet the\nmoment our eyes met with a perfect stranger. I&#39;m wise enough now not to deny\nthat it might be possible, but also to know that it&#39;s not the only option.</p>\n<p>Options are important: me limiting myself to just one type of relationships\ndidn&#39;t go very well. I&#39;m not your typical damsel in distress, you see, as per\npublic opinion I&#39;m rather a dragon slaying knight. So sitting and waiting in my\ntower was never my cup of tea.</p>\n<p>I went on many romantic adventures, but to be honest it was more of a scientific\nresearch as I put a lot of thought into it. It was a small, but a long lasting\nresearch and I&#39;m not even close to a final conclusion, so take it with a grain\nof salt.</p>\n<h2 id=\"love-as-a-feeling\">Love as a feeling</h2>\n<p>My first theory was that love is sort of an emotional explosion. You go on with\nyour day and Boom - you&#39;re in love! But that would mean that I have no say in it\nand yet somehow whenever I was &quot;falling in love&quot; there was a certain pattern.</p>\n<p>In my teenage years I&#39;ve been crushing on all the popular ones. They looked\ndifferently, but being associated with them would have given me a status I\nwanted, I guess. Of course back then I was sure that every time it was a genuine\nfeeling, though it rarely lasted long.</p>\n<p>Whenever I did manage to get to know a person on a deeper level, or perhaps, get\na whisk of reciprocity, I was able to maintain that weird feeling for years. But\nmy feelings were rarely reciprocated back then, and, since I couldn&#39;t just sit\nand wait like a proper princess, I did manage to experience a variety of\nrejections.</p>\n<p>And yet, to be fair, I wasn&#39;t in love then, not with the real people at least.\nLooking back it was more of a wishful thinking - I wanted to experience love,\nthe other person didn&#39;t matter - it was all about me and, fair enough, how could\nthat have been reciprocated?</p>\n<p>So, inevitably I got tired of waiting and took the matter in my own hands.</p>\n<h2 id=\"love-as-a-choice\">Love as a choice</h2>\n<p>I&#39;ve decided that instead of relying on a feeling I could just choose a partner\nthat would have higher chances of developing feelings for me. And so when my\nclose friend made a comment about my dress with a deep cleavage and very short\nskirt, which I wore exclusively at home, I literally talked them into a\nrelationship. I knew I wasn&#39;t in love, but it didn&#39;t matter. That person cared\nfor me and I&#39;ve promised myself that I&#39;ll do my best to fake it till a genuine\nfeeling emerges.</p>\n<p>It worked for a while. Actually, not giving too much importance to a\nrelationship or one person made a lot of things easier. I guess, I could call\nthat arrangement &quot;friends with benefits&quot;. We were really good at benefits and\nthat alone had us going on for years! But as friends we sucked more and more.</p>\n<p>Turns out, it&#39;s really hard to be honest when you need to pretend most of the\ntime. In the end I gave up. They weren&#39;t happy, but inevitably came to the same\nconclusion: we never really loved each other and once we started fighting we\nslowly killed all the care we had.</p>\n<p>And so feelings did matter.</p>\n<h2 id=\"love-conquers-all\">Love conquers all</h2>\n<p>Walking away from a marriage, that I didn&#39;t want, was a right choice, but it\nalso felt like I walked away from ever having a family of my own. And so I\ndesperately wanted what I had just lost.</p>\n<p>After some trial and error I met my Prince Charming. He swoop me of my feet with\nall the right words, I fell in love like I had never fallen before and my very\nown heterosexual fairy tale unraveled right in front of me.</p>\n<p>He said he loved me within days, he proposed within weeks. And we were so alike!\nHe was handsome, talented, smart and, finally, smitten by me, just as I was by\nhim.</p>\n<p>We moved in together and I poured my whole self into this relationship. I&#39;ve\nswooped everything that wasn&#39;t fitting into the fairy tale under the rug. I\ndidn&#39;t tell him that I was intimate with one of my girlfriends as he already\nfound her obnoxious. I didn&#39;t tell him that she wasn&#39;t the only one I had\nfeelings for either.</p>\n<p>I became a mother! I now had a family! How could I possibly be anything but\nperfect, especially when my husband was already so very vocal about the flaws of\nmy social circle.</p>\n<p>As it turned out, I do can give into love and let years pass by without noticing\nthe obvious. And when the obvious became blatantly obvious and I could no longer\ntrick myself back into a fairy tale. I was crushed, but I was also very\nresilient.</p>\n<p>I did tell my soon-to-be-ex-husband I was bisexual in the end: at this point he\ndidn&#39;t care anymore, but it felt good to let it out.</p>\n<p>At first it was scary: me alone with two kids, realizing that I&#39;ve spent a third\nof my life being married to figment of my imagination. But I was also a bad ass\nprofessional with an amazing job - I was safe on my own! It&#39;s incredible what\nyou can become when you don&#39;t have a choice for so long.</p>\n<p>And now I had a choice!</p>\n<h2 id=\"love-is-a-choice-one-more-time-with-a-feeling\">Love is a choice: One more time, with a feeling!</h2>\n<p>I had choices. It was amazing to see that the moment we ended things I&#39;ve\nnoticed people being attracted to me once again. I guess they were always there,\nbut I never let myself notice anyone else while I was in a committed\nrelationship.</p>\n<p>For a brief moment I got to experience crushes of incredible strength: my best\nguess it that I had so much affection bottled within that it started spilling\nout like a fountain the moment I got free.</p>\n<p>Luckily for me I got to my senses pretty quick, without giving into the\nimpulses.</p>\n<p>My marriage and specifically the way it ended taught me to trust my instincts\nand to never ever again settle for something I don&#39;t want.</p>\n<p>It took me a bit to figure out what I want though. As opposed to ten years ago,\nnow I didn&#39;t want <em>any</em> relationship: I wanted a very specific one.</p>\n<p>I wanted to be heard, understood and celebrated for being myself. I wanted trust\nand safety. I wanted a person to call home.</p>\n<p>My list was a bit longer than that and included couple of points about same\nviews on relationship and sex, ability to take care of themselves and,\nultimately, a requirement to have their own life that they&#39;d proudly choose to\nshare with me. Emotional connection and ability to create and maintain one,\nalong with intelligence and resilience that I imagine one must have to do so,\nwere probably the strictest of my &quot;demands&quot;.</p>\n<p>For the first time in my life I was ready to wait for this relationship; I was\nready to be present in my own skin, to take interest in the person I&#39;m with.</p>\n<p>And that led me to the conclusion I&#39;m at now:</p>\n<p>There&#39;s no one size fits all and there&#39;s definitely more than one person that\nwould fit my description of a perfect partner. I didn&#39;t want to limit my options\nto one ethnicity, gender, religion or certain appearance - I did learn that for\nme none of it mattered. Time mattered, though, as it takes time to learn how to\ncommunicate and get to know one another.</p>\n<p>I believe that true love is so much more than just a feeling, though attraction\nshould, of course, come naturally. I believe it&#39;s more than a choice too: it&#39;s a\ngazillion of choices one would make every day. A conscious choice to love that\none person, giving up on every other &quot;one&quot; there might be. A choice to be\nyourself and lead your life with pride and joy as one should feel for their best\nwork.</p>\n<p>Love, I think, happens when we look deep within ourselves, learn everything we\ncan about our needs, wants and purpose, take this knowledge and make the one we\ndeem worthy our Chosen One.</p>\n<p>And surrendering this power to chance, blind faith or, worse, someone else,\nfeels like a waste of time.</p>\n"},"being-authentic-and-not-giving-a-damn":{"title":"Being authentic and not giving a damn of what others think","date":"2023-05-28T19:14:18.889Z","author":"ValeriaVG","tags":["identity","psychology","relationships"],"summary":"On so many occasions I have been told to just be myself, yet it took me a while to figure out\nwho I am and what it means to be me. \nAdding other people to the equation was and still is an even bigger challenge, \nbut I do believe I figured a thing or two about it along the way.\n","url":"being-authentic-and-not-giving-a-damn","content":"<p>What is your favourite colour? Such an innocent question, isn&#39;t it? Yet it truly\npuzzled me that I didn&#39;t have a definitive answer. Most of my clothes were\nblack, but I wasn&#39;t sure if that was because I liked it or because someone at\nsome point convinced me that it would make me look slimmer or wouldn&#39;t show\nstains as easy as lighter colours. How do I know what I like? Can I just choose\nsome random colour and decide that from now on that would be my favourite?</p>\n<p>My therapist said that it doesn&#39;t work this way. Apparently one is supposed to\njust know what you want. Well, at that point I didn&#39;t want anything. I didn&#39;t\ncare much about myself then and most of my efforts have been spent on other\npeople. Other people were very important force in my life: they were deciding\nhow I should look and behave, what I&#39;m allowed to wear, where I should spend my\nmoney and nearly everything else.</p>\n<p>I don&#39;t blame them, I wouldn&#39;t know who to blame, to be honest: after so many\nyears I wouldn&#39;t be able to trace where my limiting beliefs came from even if I\ntried. Faceless generic &quot;others&quot; was a monstrosity with many faces and voices\nand not a shred of compassion or empathy.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve been this way up until the moment the same therapist confirmed that I was\nundoubtedly autistic. It might not sound like much, but for me it meant the\nworld: I was very very different from the <em>others</em> and thus their beliefs could\nno longer apply to me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"who-am-i-really\">Who am I, really?</h2>\n<p>Asking myself this question at the ripe age of 36 was a bit weird to say the\nleast, but at that point I&#39;ve accepted that <em>weird</em> is my new normal.</p>\n<p>I started digging into my own psyche as if it would be a codebase I&#39;m seeing for\nthe first time: I tried to find patterns and refrain from judgement.</p>\n<p>I assumed there was a <em>core</em>; something that makes me my authentic self. It must\nbe something permanent or at least long lasting, something that would describe\nme years ago, today and in the future.</p>\n<p>Well, I was autistic, for starters; this influenced the way I perceive the world\naround me, the way I behave and explains why my emotions have always been so\nmuch stronger than <em>others</em> expected of me.</p>\n<p>So, the emotions then are influenced by my identity, right? If so, I could use\nit to reverse-engineer my core values!</p>\n<p>I started to really listen to my emotions: I&#39;ve journaled every single day,\nspent many hours with myself and talked obsessively about my feelings with\nanyone who would listen to try and pinpoint why I felt the way I felt.</p>\n<p>One of the things that I&#39;ve realized was that I value deep emotional connections\nmore than anything else: having authentic relationships has always been my first\npriority. But it only became obvious when I heard Brené Brown&#39;s talk about\nvulnerability: I had a surge of emotions and a feeling of being truly seen and\nunderstood.</p>\n<p>As a result I&#39;ve started to learn how to be more vulnerable and less afraid.\nThat meant speaking up, sharing my thoughts, ideas and creations without knowing\nfor sure how they would be received. Whenever I was in doubt I just needed to\nask myself if would I still do it even no one else would accept it?</p>\n<p>It was scary the first couple of times. Of course, I started with the things\nthat wouldn&#39;t have significant effect: like sharing some ideas about\nimprovements at work. I knew that if they wouldn&#39;t be accepted - it wouldn&#39;t\ncost me anything, except for maybe a bit of a hurt pride.</p>\n<p>To my surprise it didn&#39;t hurt as much as I imagined. I guess being ready for a\nchallenge somehow made me more resilient to a failure. But most of my\nsuggestions have been met with praise and that gave me confidence to start\ntaking bigger risks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-letting-go-and-drawing-lines\">The art letting go and drawing lines</h2>\n<p>I liked being celebrated! I liked being taken seriously! And quickly realized I\nwanted to feel this way most of the time. I&#39;ve started celebrating myself: this\nfelt too important to outsource. I wrote myself letters, saying all the things I\nwanted to hear from others, pointing out all my achievements and reminding\nmyself that every little mistake I make gives me an opportunity to grow and be\neven better.</p>\n<p>That worked quite well! I was finally starting to accept myself unconditionally\nand gaining more and more confidence.</p>\n<p>The more my self-esteem grew the less tolerant I was becoming to being treated\nless than I deserved. I didn&#39;t yet know what I wanted, but I was certain about\nwhat I didn&#39;t want.</p>\n<p>I was surprised how easy it was to let go of my marriage: I knew I didn&#39;t want\nany more lies and uncertainty and, since my every attempt to communicate my\nneeds and find a compromise failed, my conscience was clear.</p>\n<p>I let go of people who couldn&#39;t respect my newly found needs. It was scary to\nset boundaries at first, but my daughters helped me a lot with it - they were\namong the first ones to accept and help me maintain them. Which was surprising,\nas we used to fight a lot about the same mundane stuff them making a mess and\nnot cleaning up or making avoidable noise when I was trying to concentrate, to\nname a few.</p>\n<p>And yet, when I was able to calmly communicate what I needed, they started to\neither respect it or negotiate an alternative to match their needs as well. We\nstill have screaming matches every once in a while, after all they are very\nyoung and I&#39;m still learning too, but we got so much closer to each other and\ncan now proactively care for one another!</p>\n<p>Who would have thought that boundaries can do that?!</p>\n<h2 id=\"budgeting-the-fs-to-give\">Budgeting the f***s to give</h2>\n<p>I clearly care a lot about my children and that I wouldn&#39;t want to change ever,\nyet a lot of other things I cared about used to get in a way of that. My first\nthree years in Sweden I spent working long hours to try and make the company I\nworked for succeed. I told myself that I did it for my family: our finances were\nscarce and I rationalized that more money would solve all of our problems.</p>\n<p>But, truth be told, I was using my work to hide from said problems: working a\nlot was tiring, but it was also easy because I knew exactly what to do at every\ngiven moment. Not to mention the praise I was receiving for being such a hard\nworker! Would I work as much if I knew that the startup worked for would fail?\nNo, I wouldn&#39;t. I desperately wanted to matter and I hoped that if I&#39;d succeed\npublicly that would mean that I&#39;m worth something.</p>\n<p>I did learn a lot from this experience and thus I don&#39;t feel like my time was\nwasted, but I do see now how valuable my time is. There&#39;s a limited amount of\nhours in any given day and I&#39;m pretty sure that eventually I&#39;ll start getting\nolder. And so there&#39;s a strictly limited amount of f*cks I can give.</p>\n<p>Just like I started to learn how to be financially responsible by choosing the\nbiggest value for the least amount of money, I started to consciously choose who\nand what I spend my energy on.</p>\n<p>I couldn&#39;t care anymore about the things outside of my control as no matter how\nmuch resources I poured I would&#39;ve made zero difference. Flushing down the drain\ndidn&#39;t sound like a smart investment after all!</p>\n<p>I was still taking risks, sometimes I was losing miserably, sometimes I was\nhitting a jackpot and mostly I found myself somewhere in between those two. But\ndecision making became easier: I could just imagine several outcomes, analyze my\nemotions, match whatever I was trying to achieve with my core values and needs\nand make a conscious choice of how I wanted to proceed.</p>\n<p>With every choice I made I gained a deeper insight on what I wanted and soon\nenough I could visualize and more importantly verbalize my desires in details.\nAs well as the reasons behind those wants and needs.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s a process and there&#39;s a lot of room for improvement still, yet my life\nbecame much more joyous than it had ever been before.</p>\n<p>My favourite colour is white, by the way.
